LVM

Partions are abstracted, they could all be on a single drive, or be spread out, partially or fully, across multiple drives.  Linux doesn't use drive letters; instead, Linux uses a unifed directory tree.  
Each partition is mounted at a mount point in that tree. A mount point is a directory that's used in a way to access the filesystem to the mount point.  

A "mount point" is a directory that's used to access the filesystem on the partition, and mounting the filesystem is the process of linking the filesystem to the mount point. 

Security Enhanced Linux is a kernel loadable module with stronger permissions around quarantining users to specific partitions.


When and how to create multiple partitions

The root partition is required, and a swap partition is a very good idea.
/boot partition can be helpful on hard disks of more than 8gb.

When you get it wrong, you either have to resize your partitions or set up symboliclinks between partitions so that subdirectories on one partition can be stored on other partitions.
Resizing also results in downtime.

Things may differ from system to system. A workstation might have a very small /var partition while a mail server might have one gigabytes in size. Is this a workstation or server.

fdisk

gnu parted 
- more features than fdisk
- parted /dev/hda


Preparing partition for use

Once a partition is created, you must prepare it for use.
Also called "Making a file system" or "formatting a partition". It involves writing low-level data structures to disk.
the word "formatting" is somewhat ambiguious. Low level formatting creates a structure of sectors and tracks on the disk media.
High level formatting, which creates a filesystem.  Hard disks are low level formatted at the factory and should never need to be low-level formatted again. 


Ext2fs 

The second extended file system, Ext3fs is third with journaling. Ext4fs deals with very large disks or very large files.
